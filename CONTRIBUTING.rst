Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute that is awesome. Remember to be nice to others in issues and reviews.

**It is nice if you follow this list:**

* Follow pep8 (run flake8).
* Follow the import sorting guidelines (run isort).
* Write tests for the cool things you create or fix.

Unsure about something from that list or anything else? No worries, `open an issue`_ or ask a
question on `gitter`_ and someone will help you out.

Commit messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since python-semantic-release is released with python-semantic-release we need the change
level tags in the commit message. They are listed below. If you are unsure which tag is appropriate
just ask or take a guess. If we think it should be something else or there is a pull-request without
tags we will help out in adding or changing them.
